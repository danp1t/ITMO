**"The Nigerian Souvenir Mystery"**  

On Murtala Muhammed Way, near Loco Football Field, stood an old house where four friends—three men and a woman—gathered one evening. They ventured to a restaurant on Banana Street, drawn by its exotic Nigerian décor. Unbeknownst to them, two champagne bottles at their table had been poisoned.  

As they toasted, security suddenly locked the restaurant doors after hearing chaotic shouts outside. Trapped, the group panicked. Meanwhile, a coconut tree, oddly placed in the fireplace, began burning, filling the room with smoky sweetness.  

The next morning, police found the four unconscious but alive. The poisoned champagne had claimed no lives, yet a diamond—part of the Nigerian souvenirs—was missing. In the garden, monkey footprints led to a tree where the creature sat, chattering. An X-ray later revealed the gem *inside* the monkey’s stomach—it had snatched the diamond, mistaking it for food.  

The burning coconut tree? A prank by the chef, who hated the décor. The poisoned champagne? A failed robbery plot by a rival collector.  

Thus, the "cursed" souvenir became legend: a diamond lost to a monkey’s appetite, and a night where danger flickered brighter than the flames.
